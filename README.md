## Overview

### Description
This apps allows you to save restaurants, coffee-shops, and more in your own personal cool-places directory. This way you will always have places you really liked and would like to go again at 3-clicks distance. Also, you can share any place with your friends so they can go to, get directions to any place you have liked, and also get to see what's new near your location, and places you may like in your feed.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Utilities (because you save what you like to keep it handy) and social (because you can share with your friends and see what they like) and follow people to get places they have gone too
- **Mobile:** Mobile-first (android)
- **Story:** As a user you can save your created places privately or share them with your followers (or external apps like facebook). Also you can view your friends profile's to see what they like and what have they shared with the world. People can follow you to see what you share. 
- **Market:** People looking for cool places to dine, drink a coffee, get a drink, or spend some time in a city. "Foodies".
- **Habit:** People come back because they want to see what cool places can they visit next, where to eat according to their interests, find places nearby, etc.
- **Scope:** Starting it is a place where you share your likes and cool places you know, and follow people that do that too. Later on, the app could be monetized by selling place-owners spaces on people's feed to show their place like advertisements, according to what people tend to like (interests). Get directions using Google Maps, or notifications whenever someone you follow posts something you may like.

    - **My own Convolutional Neural Network based on MobileNetV2 architecture was embedded into the app to classify images into the app's 5 categories**
        - Used a scrapper on Javascript to get up to 500 images from a search on Google Images
        - Used python to download the images, create the model, preprocess the images, train the model, and export the model as TensorFlow Lite
        - Used Visual Studio tools to embedd the model into the app
        - Used Java to preprocess the image taken from the cell-phone and process the output from the model in order to predict the category
        - [More information](https://github.com/pablo-blancoc/PlacesApp-ml)
    - **Created a Recommendation System using k nearest-neighbors algorithm**
        - Get all information about the users using the app
        - Find 4 most similar users to you
        - Recommend up to 5 places they have liked but you haven't
        - [More information](https://github.com/pablo-blancoc/PlacesApp-server)
    - **Implemented tf-idf and cosine similarity algorithms to enhance search**

### Deep Learning model

In this [repository](https://github.com/pablo-blancoc/PlacesApp-ml) it is all the information of the Deep Learning model implemented inside the app which classifies an image taken into the 5 categories the app has.

### Backend server

In this [repository](https://github.com/pablo-blancoc/PlacesApp-server) it is all the information of the backend server that runs locally and that allows the app do things like recommend a place to a user, and send notifications to users.
